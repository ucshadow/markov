And yet clearly you didn't read the manifesto post.

> The purpose of Mods is to override the regular game rules.
Get over it.  If your argument is that zero mods should equal normal rarity item then you're neglecting the fact that you can make a 2 mod rare with a regal on a 1 mod magic item.
What are you angry about? This method makes the crafting meta much more exciting and different from other ARPGs and it allows you to get strong items without much rng. A welcomed change if you ask me.
To quote my own post from the development manifesto thread:
>Why does an orb of scouring, which "Removes all properties from an item", turn a rare item into a normal one when removing all mods using master crafting keeps the item rare, which clearly shows that rarity is not tied to the amount of properties?

>How can an user be expected to know the order in which mods were removed from an item (allowing the master mods to keep certain properties when the mods themselves got removed)?

>Unintuitive and inconsistent mechanics like these are a sign that the system was not well designed, and, combined with the prohibitively high investment of time and currency required to test interactions, should have been either redesigned or explained better when released
